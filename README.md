Educational files for students
In this repository, I pushed projects, which I taught in ```National Organization for Developing Special Talents High School```, my previous high school as well. 

### Educational files of C:
In this section, we implememnted some basic codes with each other in order to familiarize ourselves how to think in an inovative way, and stand out of others. Finally, we designed two cool projects.
- Large Digit Calculator: this project challenges students to develop a calculator which can perform multi digit opertaion, up to 100.

### C# project:
We also designed a gui calculator based on prfix, postfix., based on ```Data structures & Algorithms```.

### Projects with Python:
We designed cool projects with python, such as YouTube downloader.

### Cpp project:
```Fast inverse square root```: a magical number which is used in some games.
